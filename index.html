        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketing</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second-year student at the University of California, Riverside. My major is currently undeclared within the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, but I am planning to declare a major at the end of this academic year. I am pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration with a marketing emphasis. I was originally admitted to the university to study biochemistry. I decided to make the switch to business administration after reflecting on my interests and goals for my career. I have a desire to work in the skincare and cosmetics industry, but rather than working in a laboratory setting for product development, I have realized that my skillset and way of thinking would be better suited for the marketing aspect of this field.<br><br>

        Aside from being a full-time student at UCR, I also work part-time as a retail associate at Marshalls. I have been employed at this store since October of 2022. This is the first job I have ever had, and it has allowed me to gain experience in customer service and engagement, as well as retail processes and organization. I mainly work as a cashier, but I have also worked on the sales floor and in the stock room. When working as a cahsier, I am responsible for providing a pleasant experience for customers, as well as offering them input on merchandise and selling them the benefits of our company rewards credit card. When working on the sales floor and in the stock room, I am responsible for the flow and organization of new merchandise, as well as recovery of displays. Regardless of the position I am assigned to, I am always responsible for taking part in loss prevention strategies and reporting loss of merchandise. Since this is only my first job, I would like to eventually branch out to other positions. Whether that is another retail job or a corporate internship, further experience in various areas of the business field would be greatly beneficial for me.<br><br>

        Prior to being employed at Marshalls, I gained volunteer and leadership experience through church and school. I volunteered as a small group leader in preschool classrooms at my local church for several years. Going through middle and high school, I was in band, and I participated in the leadership group for my high school band. Being part of this group, I was responsible for being a role model for the younger band members, as well as volunteering at all events. I was also a teaching assistant for the directors of my high school band, where I aided mostly in classroom organization. From these experiences, I developed several organizational and people skills. I even earned the honor of receiving a medal of altruism as an acknowledgment of my work perfomred in these roles. I greatly value the skills I have developed and the experience I have gained over the last several years, and I plan to carry them with me as I pursue my career.
